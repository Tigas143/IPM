_**How to run**_



Clone this repo
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Tigas143/IPM.git 
```

Followed by
```bash
python -m http.server
```
In case the window doesn't work, replace "0.0.0.0:" with "localhost:"

Everytime you make changes on the code, make sure to refresh the page that was open with the last command :)
